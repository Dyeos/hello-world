Hello

I'm a student barely heading into my 2nd semester of CS and decided to make an account to help me with my journey through it.
I'm getting bored of the homeworks I've been recieving in class and would rather focus my time and effort to becoming a better programmer.
I'm intrigued to find what other people have been making and would like to learn from them instead of my boring professor in class.
